MEWER (MEWsician's Exercises for Rhythms) is an online game to practice
clapping or tapping rhythms.  Using [haXe](http://haxe.org/) and
[xinf](http://xinf.org/trac), this game is available for Flash 9+ and
Javascript.

This project uses [MEWES](http://code.google.com/p/mewes/) to generate the
rhythmic exercises.
