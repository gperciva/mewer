Microphone:

If you don't have one, or don't want to enable
microphone permission, you can hit SPACE instead of
clapping or tapping.  It's more fun when you make noise, though.

Gathering silence:
</strong></dt>
<dd>

noises you make normally.  Make your chair squeak, talk to your

much louder than normal household noise.
