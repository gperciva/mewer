<h4>MEWER: instructions and comments</h4>

<p>
You must have Flash 8 (or higher) and Javascript enabled.
</p>

<p>
Size: this is supposed to mimic an iPhone, which is 480x320.  I'll
add a double-sized version for people over the age of 30.
</p>

<p>
Microphone: if you don't have one, or don't want to enable
microphone permission, you can hit SPACE instead of
clapping or tapping.  It's more fun when you make noise, though.
</p>

<p>
Gathering silence: don't try to be quiet here -- make whatever
noises you make normally.  Make your chair squeak, talk to your
family, leave the dishwasher turned on, etc.  Claps are generally
much louder than normal household noise.  To re-calibrate the
silence, reload this page.
</p>

<p>
When you have your score, press ENTER to advance to the next
exercise.  There are only 2 exercises right now.
</p>

<p>
Score: I'm a cellist, so I consistently get above 97%.  If you're
a singer, you're probably lucky to get above 50%.  :P   Other
instruments will fall somewhere in between those.  (singers: go
ahead and try to prove me wrong by posting your scores on my blog.
It will be good practice for when I put the <b>real</b> exercises
on MEWER.  These two exercises are from levels 1 and 3 out of 10.)
